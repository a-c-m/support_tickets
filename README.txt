NOTICE
---------------------
Further development stalled on this project due to the reliance on a module suite called Comment Driven which never worked properly. A migration process has been made available at https://github.com/budda/support_tickets/wiki/Migrating-from-support_tickets-to-Case-Tracker

I have left the project here for technical reference only. Don't use it.

ABOUT 
---------------------
A very simple, extendable, ticketing system for use with Open Atrium.
Similar to the built in case tracker but simpler to use and customize. 

INSTALL
---------------------
Same as any other feature.

TODO
---------------------
 * Theme and layout tweaks
